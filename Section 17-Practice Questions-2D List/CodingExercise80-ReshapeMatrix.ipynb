    "Description:\n",
    "In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape that reshapes a matrix of dimensions m x n into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data in row-traversing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of rows and columns of the wanted reshaped matrix. The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reshape operation with the given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix. Otherwise, output the original matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "mat (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing an m x n matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "r (int): The number of rows for the reshaped matrix.\n",

    "c (int): The number of columns for the reshaped matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "List[List[int]]: The reshaped matrix or the original matrix if reshaping isn't possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: mat = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], r = 1, c = 4\n",
